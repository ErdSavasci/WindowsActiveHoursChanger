Dependencies
------------
Windows10ActiveHoursChanger.cmd depends on Show-BalloonTip.ps1 (In same folder)
Windows10ActiveHoursChanger_Single.cmd depends nothing

* Both cmd scripts need to be in the same folder with Windows10ActiveHoursChanger.ico to show the icon. 
  But, it is not mandatory. If the .ico file is not found, icon of the Powershell is shown.
* Running as Administrator is not needed.
