<img alt="WindowsActiveHoursChanger" src="./Windows10ActiveHoursChanger_notcompressed.ico" width="100" height="100">

Change active hours of Windows 10 as starting from the current hour to 18 hours later. Currently Windows support max 18 hours for the active hours range. To prevent the possibility of machine restart after any update, the script can be set to run periodically.

Example of the working principle:
<br>
Assuming current datetime is 20200730 18:07
<br>
Active Hours will be 20200730 18:00 (Start Hour) - 20200731 12:00 (End Hour)
