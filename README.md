<img alt="WindowsActiveHoursChanger" src="./Windows10ActiveHoursChanger_notcompressed.ico" width="100" height="100">

Change active hours of Windows 10 as starting from the current hour to 18 hours later. Currently Windows support max 18 hours for the active hours range. To prevent the possibility of machine restart after any update, the script can be set to run periodically.

Example of the working principle:
<br>
Assuming current datetime is 2020-07-30 18:07
<br>
Active Hours will be 2020-07-30 18:07 (Start Hour) - 2020-07-31 12:07 (End Hour)
